### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project that in inspired by Conway's Game of Life challenge. I am currently trying to find a way to make the map infinite so it can keep growing, or possibly instead making it a sphere where it can loop back on itself.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about running programs concurrently, as well as learning about more advanced algorithms and the design features that go with them
