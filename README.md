### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project that in inspired by Conway's Game of Life challenge. I am trying to find a way to make the map infinite so it can keep growing, or possibly instead making it a sphere where it can loop back on itself. 
- I am also working on another game in my Husky Game Development enterprise. It is an option thing that my school, Michigan Technological University, offers where people come together and build a game in Unity. This time I am developing a game called "Run to the Rescue", where it is a 2D side scroller and you must run for as long as you can and try to rescue people.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about running programs concurrently, as well as learning about more advanced algorithms and the design features that go with them
