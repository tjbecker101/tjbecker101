### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project that is inspired by Conway's Game of Life challenge. I am trying to find a way to make the map infinite so it can keep growing, or possibly instead making it a sphere where it can loop back on itself. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about cryptography systems and how to create the appropriate documentation that is required with any CS related project
